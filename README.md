## 🔬⚛️ Particle Life Simulator

A Python-based simulation of interacting particles inspired by biological systems and emergent behavior.

This project aims to implement a performant and visually appealing particle system where multiple particle types follow attraction and repulsion rules, resulting in complex dynamic structures.

## 🔧 Features (planned)

- Customizable number of particles
- Multiple particle types with interaction matrix
- Real-time or recorded visualization
- Adjustable parameters (e.g., friction, force range, randomness)
